# React Gravity Simulator

An interactive gravity simulation built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project demonstrates particle physics interactions with gravitational forces in a web browser.

## Features

- Real-time gravity simulation
- Interactive particle creation
- Customizable gravity points with different masses
- Draggable gravity sources
- Debug visualization of forces and velocities
- Configurable physics parameters
- Particle trails
- Fullscreen mode

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Ant Design
- Framer Motion
- Custom Physics Engine

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-gravity.git
cd react-gravity
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

- Click anywhere on the screen to create particles
- Drag the gravity points to influence particle movement
- Use the settings panel to adjust physics parameters
- Toggle debug visualizations for forces and velocities
- Use the star palette to create new gravity points

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
